# Intuition
The code appears to check whether a given integer n is a power of three.

# Approach

  Initialization:
    Initialize a variable ans to 1.
    
  Loop:
  Iterate over the loop for i from 0 to 30 (since we're working with 32-bit integers).
  Inside the loop:
    Check if n is equal to the current value of ans.
      If true, return true as n is a power of three.
    Check if the product of ans and 3 is within the limits of INT_MAX.
      If true, update ans by multiplying it by 3.
      
  Return:
  If the loop completes without finding a match, return false indicating that n is not a power of three.
  
# Complexity
  Time complexity:
    O(log n)- The loop runs for at most log3(n) iterations.
    
  Space complexity:
    O(1) - Constant space usage throughout the algorithm.
